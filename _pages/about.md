Hi! Welcome to my homepage!

I am Chengyi Qin, a PhD candidate in Information Security at the School of Mathematics, Shandong University (since 2023), under the supervision of [Prof. Mingqiang Wang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/wangmingqiang1/zh_CN/index.htm). Since September 2025, I have been a visiting student at the School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS), Singapore Management University, hosted by [Prof. Haiyang Xue](https://haiyangxc.github.io/hyxue/). 

My research lies in secret sharing and secure multi-party computation (MPC), with interests in verifiable/asynchronous secret sharing, distributed key generation, and threshold cryptography.
